# Rationale
When a passive becomes an active it undertakes the services of the active, however there may be no passive to undertake the services of the passive. Thus in the time between a new passive being orchestrated the active will service the passive services. Once a passive has been elected then the new active will revoke those passive services.

ie active handles service-A and passive handles service-B
when passive becomes active it handles service-A and existing service-B until a passive has been elected.

This is an optimization feature and has not been implemented.
